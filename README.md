# techdegree-project9
 This is the 9th project in Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree

 In this project, we’ll create a **REST API** using *Express*. The API will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users will be able interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

To complete this project, we’ll use our knowledge of *REST API* design, *Node.js*, and *Express* to create *API* routes, along with the *Sequelize ORM* for data modeling, validation, and persistence. To test the application, you'll use *Postman*, a popular application for exploring and testing REST APIs.
